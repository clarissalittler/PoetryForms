I worship the moon and the stars,
I lose myself in the sacred void
that swims with endless energy
the infinitude: holy
beyond our comprehension.
I was taught to worship a righteous God,
a being of absolute power, wrath, envy
His jealously intertwined with his love-cruelty
He was a God who I tried to love, a father
I wanted to please and a distant
listener always holding
every thought captive
I was trapped and alone
I was emptied out
a vessel

Nothing
Can grow
Nothing
Can build itself
back up because nothing is
really ever just nothing and
the vacuum pulses with life
and the universe is
never empty but is
full of creation, breathing
in & out, rising, falling, being
Nothing is ever lost or wasted
and all the time I mourn is
endless fabric of space


I have been so small
and I have been so nothing
but the fullness of nothing made me whole 
and the pressure of eternal self-creation
let me finally exist under my own
strength. So now instead of the jealous
rage-filled god, who hollowed me out
I can worship the moon
the stars and the endless void
because they know me in an
intimacy that
God couldn't.
We are
endless.
