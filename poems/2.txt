A multiplicity of selves like stars
A hundred thousand futures crystalizing
I've never been singular person but 
maybe a few of me can be worthy of praise

I touch a mirror in the morning, by evening I see
a trinity staring back at
this wretchedness, they
were man, woman, and a holy

Androgyne, angel
of the Lord, empty
of the law of Man
covered in endless eyes
a terror to
behold and they said BE NOT

AFRAID, and I could not
obey. And they said BEHOLD
BEHOLD, without
a voice. BEHOLD
BEHOLD YOUR SAL-
VATION they vibrated
through me and the pain
was a voice
and the voice had
a name and the

name was my own for
I was called to remake my
self by all of me who had failed. And
I was called to be reborn by
monstrous holy self
and I pray to
it. I speak in tongues so that
we may live unbent by laws of Man
