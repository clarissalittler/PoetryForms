     The reciprocity of our mutual
     destruction, eternity ensured in full
    avarice--consumptive--future cull 
   and the world replaced. dull
    flesh has become vestigial

     this the promise of a god so genial
       he would wipe out all that has been so he can make his will inviolable
        and we must accelerate extraction of the biological
       for when the world is burned and hope gone, we escape: raptural
      the new heaven and earth/a paradise/a lull
    
    salvation ours, stasis makes will null
    holy statues, immovable
