We are
Forgetting everything
we will be
the viscosity of
memory is
holding us a-
float but languid, pulling
ourselves through uncer
tainty
towards nothing that can be
realized or forseen

How can any of us
make a future when they
say the end is now but
life is what
happens
when you're prep-
ping for the end
